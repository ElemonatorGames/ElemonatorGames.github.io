      September marks a number of milestones for Elemonator Games Inc. (EGI)
      Thanks to InteractiveNB partnering with Shred Consulting, EGI was able to
      work with Shred Consulting to submit a wickedly successful CMF application
      for our project Tidebound. We now officially have a funded runway to start
      honing in on the next hit game! But this is just the start.
    </p>

    <p>
      It has also been confirmed that Shred Consulting is running their Scaffold
      Institute Cohort starting October that eligible NB studios have a chance
      to participate in. This program aims to empower studios with tools,
      mentorships, and global market access in order for them to thrive. EGI is
      super excited to participate in this four-month program so we can really
      level up as a studio and build a stronger network.

      Now that the ball is rolling, the needs are starting to appear in front of
      us. <b
        >We are looking for 2-3 artists and creatives to help our projects
        visually come to life!</b
      > This is our biggest need to date. Following this need, we would also love
      to connect with people who have market research skills to help us hone in and
      connect with our target audience.
    </p>

    <p>

      project details, general chatter, etc.), don’t hesitate to connect with us
